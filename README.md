# Python Scripts Overview

The `motion_detection` folder contains the main motion detection script that you will be using and also some other scripts that can help you check the true fps and perform other simple tasks:

1. **`motion_detection_synchronized_capture.py`**: The primary script for performing motion detection and recording videos. This file includes comprehensive instructions and comments for adjusting parameters.

2. **`motion_detection_synchronized_capture_bmp.py`**: Similar to the main script but saves frames in BMP format instead of AVI.

3. **`motion_detection_no_viz.py`**: A variant of the main script that operates without displaying a camera preview window.

4. **`debug_fps.py`**: Useful for checking the effective FPS during frame saving to a buffer while motion detection is active.

5. **`easypyspin_preview_window.py`**: Displays a preview window for a single camera, without synchronization.

6. **`synchronized_capture.py`**: Captures images using two synchronized cameras.

7. **`synchronized_preview.py`**: Provides preview windows for two synchronized cameras.

8. **`synchronized_recording.py`**: Records video using two synchronized cameras.
